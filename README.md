**🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Analytics Dashboard**

**📖 Description**

The Fitness Analytics Dashboard is an interactive web-based analytics tool designed to visualize fitness-related data including client statistics, trainer performance, revenue tracking, calorie calculations, and BMI analysis.
It aims to provide gym owners, trainers, and members with an intuitive platform to monitor physical health metrics and financial performance in one centralized dashboard.

**🧠 Business Problem**

Without a unified platform, insights are fragmented, making it difficult to:

Track client engagement and memberships.

Optimize trainer allocation.

Analyze calorie and BMI trends.

Monitor revenue and expenses effectively.
